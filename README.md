# AppGress
Modern web application boilerplate (Full Stack Node Js) using mostly loved dev tools.

# Motivation

When starting a new node-js web app from scratch i had to deal with so many bilorplate stuffs and binding my favorite tools together to craft my favorite dev stack.I love Next-JS now after programming with it for course of years i feel i can't live without it.At the other hand i am interested in using fastify for API development, and many other things like `styled-components`,`grommet`,`restfull-react`,`react-hook-form` , ..., that i couldn't find theme together in a single ready to start package.So i decided to get my hands dirty and craft something with myown.
